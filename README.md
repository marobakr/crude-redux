# CRUD Application with React and Redux Toolkit

Welcome to the repository for the CRUD application built with React and Redux Toolkit.

## Description

This CRUD application is developed using React.js for the frontend, Redux Toolkit for state management, and vanilla JavaScript for interactions. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a set of data. Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of managing application state, making it more predictable and efficient.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete operations on a set of data
- State management with Redux Toolkit for predictable and efficient application state
- Responsive design for optimal user experience across devices
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic UI updates

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Redux Toolkit
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage

Feel free to explore the codebase to understand the implementation details and learn how Redux Toolkit can be integrated into a React application for state management. You can use this project as a learning resource or as a starting point for building your own CRUD applications with React and Redux Toolkit.
